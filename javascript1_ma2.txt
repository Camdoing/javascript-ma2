//MODULE ASSIGNMENT 2 - LEVEL 1

1. What is a function literal?
A function literal is another way of  defining functions, like an unnamed function. The syntax is similar to a function statement, except that it is used as an expression rather than a statement. No function name is required.

2. What is the constructor?
The constructor is a function that initializes an object. Constructor functions can be used to make multiple similar objects.

3. What does the return statement do?
The return statement is a statement, and it ends the execution of a function. It is used to specify a value (object/array/variable) to be returned to  the functions caller scope.

4. What will be written to the console from this function:
		function myFunction(){
			  return console.log('inside my function');
			  console.log('My name is Andy');
		}
		myFunction();

inside my function
<undefined

5. Briefly describe scope in JavaScript.
Scope refers to the context of your scope. It refers to where we define variables and functions. Javascript variables have two scopes: Global and local.
